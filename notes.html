<h1> URL </h1>
URL stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>. It contains several different parts, including: </h1>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>protocol</strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp </li>
<li>The <strong>host</strong>: e.g.www.facebook.com,www.bbc.co.uk</li>
<li>The <strong>path</strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95 </li>
</ul>

## DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.

## Server-side vs. Client-side technologies

### Client-side

Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

### Server-side

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
